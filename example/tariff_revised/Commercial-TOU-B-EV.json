The BEV-2 is applicable to customers with kW usage at or above 100 kW. Note that customers may be on the BEV-1 or BEV-2 at usage of 100 kW based on the customer’s preference. BEV-1 is for Secondary Voltage service, and BEV-2 was designed with a Primary and Secondary Voltage option. Transmission Voltage customers are eligible for enrollment on the BEV-2 Primary rate.",
